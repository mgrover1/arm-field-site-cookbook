However, using this methodology, it is only possible to detect phase shifts within \\pm 2\\pi due to the periodicity of the transmitted wave. Therefore, for example, a phase shift of 3\\pi would erroneously be detected as a phase shift of -\\pi and give an incorrect value of velocity when retrieved by the radar. This phenomena is called aliasing. The maximium unambious velocity that can be detected by the radar before aliasing occurs is called the Nyquist velocity.\n\nIn the next example, you will see an example of aliasing occurring, where the values of +15 m/s abruptly transition into a region of -15 m/s, with -5 m/s in the middle of the region around 37 N, 97 W.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/foundations/pyart/pyart-corrections#an-overview-of-aliasing","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Py-ART Corrections","lvl3":"Calculate Velocity Texture","lvl2":"Dealiasing our Velocity"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/foundations/pyart/pyart-corrections#calculate-velocity-texture","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Py-ART Corrections","lvl3":"Calculate Velocity Texture","lvl2":"Dealiasing our Velocity"},"content":"First, for dealiasing to work efficiently, we need to use a GateFilter.

ARM operates radars at four requency bands: W, Ka, X and C band. ARM denotes radars as either cloud or precipitation sensing. W and Ka are only denoted as cloud sensing, X is both and C is only precipitation sensing. The radars are the Marine W-Band ARM Cloud Radar (M-WACR), Ka band Zenith Radar (Ka-ZR), Ka band ARM Scanning Cloud Radar (Ka-SACR), X band Scanning ARM Radar (X-SACR), X band Scanning ARM Precipition Radar (X-SAPR) and C band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radar (C-SAPR). The notation pertain more to the operation and suitability of the radar (eg there is nothing stopping a user using KAZR to study Precipitation).\n\n\n\nBNF has a C-SAPR, X-SACR, Ka-SACR and a KaZR. Why the different wavelengths? it all comes down to sensitivity, backscatter cross section and if the scattering is in the Reighley regieme where the size of the drops are much smaller than the wavelenth.\n\n\n\nThe sensitivity gains come from the beam with can be approximated as \\theta\\approx 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D}\\quad(\\text{considering that}\\,\\sin\\theta\\approx\\theta). Bigger antenna smaller angle. Shorter wavelength smaller angle.
